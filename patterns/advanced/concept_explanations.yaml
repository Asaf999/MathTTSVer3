    machine that transforms each input \2 into a unique output, establishing a precise
    relationship between quantities

  output_template: by the chain rule, we multiply the derivative of \1 with respect
    to \3 by the derivative of \3 with respect to \4, because when functions are composed
    like nested boxes, their rates of change multiply to give us the overall rate

  pattern: \\frac\{d\}\{d([a-zA-Z])}\\int_\{([^{}]+)\}\^\{([a-zA-Z])\}\s*([^d\\s]+)\s*dt
  output_template: by the fundamental theorem of calculus, the derivative with respect
    to \1 of the integral from \2 to \1 of \4 with respect to t simply equals \4 evaluated
    at \1 - this remarkable result connects the two main operations of calculus in
    perfect harmony

- id: continuity_concept_stage3
  name: Continuity with intuitive meaning
  pattern: \\text{continuous}\\s+at\\s+([^\\s]+)
  output_template: continuous at \1, meaning the function has no sudden jumps or breaks
    at this point - you could draw it without lifting your pencil, creating a smooth,
    uninterrupted curve

  name: Differentiability with geometric insight
  pattern: \\text{differentiable}\\s+at\\s+([^\\s]+)
  output_template: differentiable at \1, which means the function has a well-defined
    tangent line at this point - the curve is not only continuous but also smooth
    enough that we can find its exact slope

  output_template: 'Euler''s breathtaking identity: e to the power of i pi plus 1
    equals zero. This equation is often called the most beautiful in mathematics because
    it elegantly connects five fundamental constants in a single, simple relationship'

  output_template: the derivative with respect to \1 of the integral of \2 with respect
    to \3, which beautifully demonstrates how differentiation and integration are
    inverse operations - like addition and subtraction, they undo each other's effects

    transform our complex expression into something more manageable - this is like
    changing our perspective to see the problem from a clearer angle

  output_template: using integration by parts, we transform \1 d\2 into \3\4 minus
    the integral of \5 d\6, strategically trading one integral for another that might
    be easier to solve - like rearranging furniture to create a clearer path
